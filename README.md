# Funny Ideas

A collection of project diagrams, architectural outlines, and brainstorming sketches for potential future development.

## What This Is

This repo is where I dump technical project ideas that might be worth building someday. Think of it as a visual notepad for system architectures, implementation plans, and "what if I built this?" concepts.

Some ideas here will get built. Some won't. Some will turn into something completely different. That's the point.

## What's Here

Project diagrams and architectural designs, mostly in SVG format. Each one represents a technical concept that seemed interesting enough to sketch out in detail.

Browse through, take what's useful, ignore what isn't.

*Not all ideas are meant to be implemented. Some are just fun to think about.*
